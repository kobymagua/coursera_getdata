# Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

This is a project assignment for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data". 

The objective of this project to demonstrate how I collected, manipulated, and cleaned a data set from wearable devices. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Wearables from companies such as Fitbit, Jawbone Up, Nike, and Apple produces a lot of data. Example is the one provided in this link from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones:
